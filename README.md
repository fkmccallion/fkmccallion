## A Little About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hi, Iâ€™m Keith! Iâ€™m a software engineer who has worked in and out of the field for the last several years. In the beginning, much of my education was self-taught and through classes taken at UCLA Extension and Cal Lutheran. I received my first professional break with [Sensortech Systems, Inc.](https://sensortech.com/) as a web developer and created their first and second website iterations using the ASP.NET Framework and C#. Once the basic layout of the site was finished much of my time was spent creating content as a subject matter expert and on SEO (which is an entirely separate field in itself).

I loved developing the website so much that it was at that time I decided to make it a career. I started an immersive software engineering bootcamp with the [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) to gain a formal education in the field. As California shut down Sensortech due to the Covid-19 virus I found it to be the perfect opportunity to finish bootcamp and to begin my search for full-time work as a software engineer. I enjoy working with Ruby on Rails, Ruby, Javascript and React.

I believe that learning is a lifelong enterprise, something I thoroughly enjoy, and a requirement as a developer.

## I'm Currently Working On ðŸ”­

[Dashboard America](https://www.dashboardamerica.com/) - A business directory that allows users to add businesses/organizations, products/services and events. It is used to help businesses improve their web presence, build links and improve SEO. This was a massive project so I have left it in open beta testing status as a minimum viable product; I will periodically update. I've added Google AdSense to earn some passive income so I created a DBA (Dashboard California) and added it to my linkedin profile as my current position (self-employed). It is currenlty a private repo but I will probably make it public once I am employed.
